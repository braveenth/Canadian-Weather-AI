# Canadian Weather AI

Environment Canada's Jet Stream map to a spoken weather forecast using multi-modal LLMs and TTS.

I thought it would be a very cool project to build something that allows for us to experience the intersection of nostalgia from the 2000s with the advances we have made recently. I added a â€œCanadian-emphasis" to it, to see how an LLM perceives and mimics Canadian linguistics and semantics. This was done through iterative Prompt Engineering, and it was quite the experience!
